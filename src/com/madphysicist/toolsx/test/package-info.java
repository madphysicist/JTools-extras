/**
 * <p>
 * Provides tools for simplifying testing. The classes in this packet are mainly
 * tailored for use under the TestNG framework. This package contains test
 * helpers that can be useful for creating tests, not test classes themselves.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>External Dependencies</b><br />
 * This package requires that TestNG be available on the classpath. TestNG usually consists of a file called {@code
 * testng.jar} and sometimes several other dependencies such as {@code jcommander.jar} (older versions also depended on
 * {@code qdox.jar} and {@code bsh.jar}). Version 5.13 or higher is recommended because the annotation {@link
 * org.testng.annotations.NoInjection} is known to have existed at least with that version. 
 * </p>

 * @author Joseph Fox-Rabinovitz
 * @version 1.0.0, 25 Oct 2012 - J. Fox-Rabinovitz - Initial coding.
